Keredhud v1.5

To install, unzip the files to your "Steam\steamapps\[username]\team fortress 2\tf" folder.

Change Log:

Version 1.5: Updated files for Pyromania weapons and special delivery mode. Slight improvements to marked and milked status icons and quickswitch menu. Removed unnecessary files (again) that changed the menu background.

Version 1.4: Added previously missing milk and marked for death icons.

Version 1.33: Fixed clipping between healer's ubercharge and last damage number.

Version 1.32: Fixed overtime label and payload race progress bar.

Version 1.31: Fixed timer using the wrong font, CTF score limit not showing, and minor clipping issues.

Version 1.3: Properly updated for Australian Christmas, all items tested except spycicle. Fixed class limits not fitting in class selection box.

Version 1.29: Updated files for Australian Christmas. The HUD has not been tested with the new weapons. As soon as I can get them (or borrow them) I will release a proper update to make them work with the hud, so be on the lookout for v1.3. If you would like to help me with this, message me on Steam.

Version 1.21: Fixed disguised HP and Monoculus HP bar.

Version 1.2: When looking at teammates, their health is now color coded (red when low, blue when overhealed). Fixed class menu. Brought ClientScheme.res and hudlayout.res up to date with official hud, fixes the appearance of some menus. Removed another file that shouldn't have been included.

Version 1.11: Fixed a bug where the ammo background box would appear when low on ammo. Removed files that had been accidentally included.

Version 1.1: Added hudanimations_tf.txt to zip. Without this, animations such as health color would not work correctly. Made non-minmode hud identical to minmode hud.

Version 1.0: Initial public release.
