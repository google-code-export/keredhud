Change Log:

Version 1.9: Version 1.9: Updated to support Scream Fortress 2013, show Soldier buff icons, and optionally support 3D player models.

Version 1.82: Slight adjustments to DemomanCharge and DemomanPipes meters so they no longer touch.

Version 1.81: Fixed MvM Boss health. Fixed "Sudden death" label getting cut off. Removed ammo icon from medigun target in MvM.

Version 1.80: Updated for Mecha Update (Australian Smissmas 2012). Fixed cutoff buttons in quickswitch menu. Fixed marked for death and milked icons clipping with health (due to an update by Valve, I can no longer control the horizontal position of these icons).

Version 1.71: Fixed clipping between Righteous Bison and Rocket ammo.

Version 1.70: Updated for Scream Fortress 2012.

Version 1.63: Removed bleed image. Removed CTF notifications.

Version 1.62: Moved Soda Popper meter to be more like other item meters, also affects sapper meter in MvM. Fixed the pipboy build and destroy menus: They now use the colors and background of the official pipboy menus, but with the layout and size of the normal Keredhud menus (thanks to Platypus for the bug report). Added difficulty to MvM scoreboard. Modified HudPlayerHealth.res to be compatible with hud crosshairs (you'll still have to install them yourself) (the appearance of health numbers is unchanged).

Version 1.61: Fixed health numbers being cut off in 16:9. Fixed special delivery flag indicator.

Version 1.6: Initial update for Mann vs. Machine. Added support for Flying Guillotine. Reverted milk and marked for death icons so they no longer clip. Brought ClientScheme.res up to date with official version. Known issues: Minmode in MvM.

Version 1.52: Fixed an issue with fonts not displaying properly and updated map loading screen to be consistent with the official version (many thanks to randomirishlad1 for reporting these bugs). Also improved add time text and removed unnecessary files.

Version 1.51: Fixed clipping with Cow Mangler, Righteous Bison, and Pompson meters.

Version 1.5: Updated files for Pyromania weapons and special delivery mode. Slight improvements to marked and milked status icons and quickswitch menu. Removed unnecessary files (again) that changed the menu background.

Version 1.4: Added previously missing milk and marked for death icons.

Version 1.33: Fixed clipping between healer's ubercharge and last damage number.

Version 1.32: Fixed overtime label and payload race progress bar.

Version 1.31: Fixed timer using the wrong font, CTF score limit not showing, and minor clipping issues.

Version 1.3: Properly updated for Australian Christmas, all items tested except spycicle. Fixed class limits not fitting in class selection box.

Version 1.29: Updated files for Australian Christmas. The HUD has not been tested with the new weapons. As soon as I can get them (or borrow them) I will release a proper update to make them work with the hud, so be on the lookout for v1.3. If you would like to help me with this, message me on Steam.

Version 1.21: Fixed disguised HP and Monoculus HP bar.

Version 1.2: When looking at teammates, their health is now color coded (red when low, blue when overhealed). Fixed class menu. Brought ClientScheme.res and hudlayout.res up to date with official hud, fixes the appearance of some menus. Removed another file that shouldn't have been included.

Version 1.11: Fixed a bug where the ammo background box would appear when low on ammo. Removed files that had been accidentally included.

Version 1.1: Added hudanimations_tf.txt to zip. Without this, animations such as health color would not work correctly. Made non-minmode hud identical to minmode hud.

Version 1.0: Initial public release.
